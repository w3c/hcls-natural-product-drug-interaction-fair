    <p>
      Concomitant use of therapeutic drugs and natural products,
        including vitamins, minerals, herbal medicinal products, and
        other botanicals, is a frequent occurrence. Concomitant
        exposure of natural products with approved pharmaceutical
        therapies raises concerns of possible natural product-drug
        interactions (NPDIs) that could lead to patient harm. Research
        on NPDIs includes studies that characterize natural product
        chemical constituents, elucidate pharmacologic mechanisms, and
        identify potential clinical impact of NPDI exposure. The
        different kinds of datasets that arise from these various
        kinds of studies range from mass spectrometric <i>to in vitro</i> and
        <i>in vivo</i> pharmacokinetics.  There is a growing recognition by
        both researchers and agencies that fund research that NPDI
        study datasets should be more findable, accessible,
        interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). The purpose of this
        Community Group Report is to propose a set of recommended
        approaches to help NPDI researchers make their data more
        FAIR. This report provides FAIR data recommendations organized
        into general and research-specific categories. The
        recommendations are written in manner intended to help
        researchers quickly identify and adopt those FAIR data
        practices most relevant to their research.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Concomitant use of therapeutic drugs and natural products, including vitamins, minerals, herbal medicinal
        products, and other botanicals, is a frequent occurrence. One study found that approximately 50% of Americans in
        their midlife were exposed to prescription drugs simultaneously with dietary supplements, many of which were
        natural products [[Kiefer-2014]]. Concomitant exposure raises concerns of possible natural product-drug
        interactions (NPDIs) leading to patient harm. Spanakis et al. reviewed the evidence for 40 top-selling herbal medicinal products and found that 6 were implicated in clinically significant pharmacokinetic NPDIs [[Spanakis-2019]]. Posadzki et al. reported several adverse outcomes of NPDIs including transplant rejection,  cardiovascular collapse, renal and liver toxicity, and death [[Posadzki-2013]]. Wilkinson et al. conducted a review that identified 81 NPDIs between 35 NPs and 31 drug classes [[Wilkinson-2016]].
    </p>
    <p>
        Research on NPDIs includes studies that characterize natural product chemical constituents, elucidate
        pharmacologic mechanisms, and identify potential clinical impact of NPDI exposure. The different kinds of
        datasets that arise from these various kinds of studies range from mass spectrometric to <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>
        pharmacokinetics. The multidisciplinary nature of NPDI research means that there is a large variety of
        approaches to archiving, sharing, and describing the datasets (i.e., generating metadata).
    </p>
    <p>
        In the face of this complexity, there is a growing recognition by both researchers and agencies that fund
        research that NPDI study datasets should be more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)[[McAlpine-2019]][[NIH-NMR-FAIR]]. This
        report proposes a set of recommended approaches to help NPDI researchers make their data more FAIR. After
        clarifying the intended audience, scope, and context, this report provides recommendations organized
        into general and research-specific categories. To
        obtain a quick overview of the recommendations and follow links to specific FAIR practices, see the <a href="#rec-summary-general">recommendations listing</a>.

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
        This report is written for anyone who generates NPDI research data. These include, but are not limited
        to, analytical chemists and clinical pharmacologists. Other natural
        product stakeholders who will also benefit from the information in this report include funding agencies that
        support NPDI research, biomedical research librarians tasked with searching and/or indexing NPDI datasets, and
        data scientists working on natural product-related analyses.
    </p>
</section>

<section class='informative'>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
        The following NPDI data are within the scope of this report:
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Chemical analytical:</i> Data derived from assays that identify, characterize and/or quantify the chemical constituents
        present in natural products.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Chemical metabolomics:</i> Data derived from assays that assess similarity and differences between natural
        products based on their chemical constituents.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>In vitro:</i> Data derived from <i>in vitro</i> systems include parameters describing natural product binding (fu
        plasma, fu mic), metabolism and transport (Km, Vmax), inhibition potency (IC50, Ki), and induction potential
        (EC50, Emax).
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>IVIVE:</i> <i>in vitro</i> to <i>in vivo</i> extrapolation approaches encompass numerous mathematical models to predict the
        magnitude of natural product-drug interactions. Mathematical models include static interaction models,
        mechanistic static models, and fully mechanistic physiologically-based pharmacokinetic interaction models.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Clinical:</i> Appropriately designed clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies involving a natural product. This includes studies where the natural product
        is the precipitant and a drug (or drugs) is the object can provide a definitive assessment of interaction risk.
        Clinical data includes pharmacokinetic outcomes (AUC, C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, t<sub>1/2</sub>) describing object drug disposition in the
        absence and presence of the precipitating natural product.

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="#Fig-context"></a> provides an overview of the
        context for this report. The contributors to this report have
        considered both the types of data and the data management
        workflows specific to chemistry and pharmacology researchers
        involved in NPDI research. They then reviewed journal
        articles, white papers, and other types of reports that make
        recommendations on how to make biomedical datasets more
        FAIR. They also reviewed specific requirements related to FAIR principles
        that are emerging from either organizations that fund NPDI
        research or journals that publish the NPDI studies. All items
        that the contributers reviewed are cited in the
        recommendations below. This report is intended to make the
        recommendations and requirements from these sources more
        accessible to researchers who study natural product chemistry
        and NPDI pharmacology. It distinguishes recommendations that
        apply generally to all types of NPDI research from those that
        are specific to natural product chemistry and NPDI
        pharmacology.
    </p>
	<aside><b>HS: So if I'm reading this correctly, there are two aims here: a) a)	Disseminate data management/FAIR best practices to a specifically NAPDI-related audience, and 
		b) to enrich the existing recommendations with ideas arising specifically from NAPDI research, incorporating use cases that might be different from the biomedical use cases typically discussed. 
		Point b) isn't made explicit but I think it's an interesting/novel contribution to biomedical data curation. To be successful, though, both of these points demand specific, <i>practical</i> applications, which I would like to see built out with more detail.</b></aside>

            <p>
                There are many ways to create a globally unique and persistent identifiers including a Globally Unique
                Identifier (GUID) generator, a program that creates Uniform Resource Identifiers using a Uniform
                Resource Name (URN), a service that creates Persistent Uniform Resource Locators (PURL), or a service
                that creates Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).
            </p>
            <p>
                If the researcher intends for the dataset identifier to also resolve to a location on the Internet, the
                researcher could obtain a DOI through an affiliate that works with DataCite.org such as services like
                Zenodo, Figshare, the Harvard Dataverse or Dryad. If the researcher works for an academic library system, the library might
                have a method to obtain DOIs.<aside><b>MR: Wouldn’t it just be if researcher works for an academic center that has library access or something?</b></aside>  For various reasons, a DOI might not be the best solution for a given
                research dataset. Some NPDI researchers share data on their laboratory website that has a specific
                domain name. In these cases, it might be possible for the researcher to create globally unique and
                persistent identifiers by combining the domain name with a GUID, URN, or a globally unique identifier
                that they create.

            <p>
                In this case, design leads to outcome. If the dataset identifiers are DOIs, GUID, URNs, or PURLs, then
                they automatically satisfy this recommendation. If not, evaluate if the creator(s) of a NPDI dataset
                explicitly states that the identifiers were designed for persistence and global uniqueness.

                mention of the identifier. This leads to the ability for researchers to locate publications related to a
                given dataset simply by searching with the identifier.

                Once a globally unique and persistent identifier exists for given dataset (see <a
                    href="#rec-identifier"></a>), researchers can write the identifier directly into an appropriate
                section in the publication or report that they are authoring. The appropriate location for mention of
                the identifier depends on the nature of the publication and the relevant formatting requirements. In
                some cases, researchers can simply mention the identifier within the methods section. Other times, it
                might be more appropriate to use a data citation formatted according to the norms of the researcher's
                discipline.[[datacite]]

                There are a number of repositories that a research could use to satisfy this recommendation including
                various Dataverse sites[[dataverse]], Zenodo[[zenodo]], Figshare[[figshare]], and Dryad[[dryad]]. 
		    
		    <aside><b>HS: Some of these repositories do not allow metadata-only deposits (which would be, what, a text file? JSON?). They want the data, with accompanying metadata. I am curious why this recommendation is not that the researcher should deposit the <i>dataset</i>, with metadata-only as a compromise if the dataset cannot be deposited for some reason.</b></aside>
			    
                A common feature of these repositories is that they ensure dataset descriptions are readable to both humans
                and computer programs such as web search crawlers. It is relatively common for a research lab to
                maintain a website that provides links to datasets created by lab members. A description of each dataset
                could be created and deposited in aforementioned repositories. 
	   <aside><b>HS: To the datasets living where? So the web would be populated with multiple persistent pointers to a single copy of a dataset living elsewhere, possibly not as persistent itself? This is weird, and I'm not saying it's a bad recommendation but I would like to know more about the reasoning behind it.</b></aside>
	    
	    Alternatively, the lab could write a
                human readable dataset description on in a location that is easy for website visitors to locate.
                However, this will not enable web search crawlers to index the metadata so that the datasets are more
                easily found via web search. To accomplish that, the website should provide the dataset description in
                the HTML head of the website as machine readable metadata using a format such as JSON-LD [[JSON-LD]] or
                HTML+RDFa [[html-rdfa]]. Examples of both human and machine readable dataset metadata are available in
                the Metadata section of the <i>Data on the Web Best Practices</i> W3C Recommendation [[dwbp]].

                programming experience can use tools such as Catalog Generator [[catalog-generator]] which can export
                standardized metadata based in information that a researcher enters into a web form or via uploading a
                spreadsheet. Other approaches include using the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval
                (CEDAR) workbench [[cedar]] or the tools listed on the Project Open Data metadata resources site
                [[project-metadata-tools]]. In terms of content, at a minimum the researcher should provide the dataset
                name, identifier (see <a href="#rec-identifier"></a>), description, creator, date of last modification,
                date of publication (if applicable), and distribution formats (if applicable) as structured metadata.
                While many established metadata standards provide attributes for general use cases, they might not
                include attributes relevant to a given research domain. In such cases, the researcher may use custom
                metadata attributes that will be recognizable by research peers and appropriate to use cases relevant to
                the researchers scientific peers.

                Researchers can utilize Google's Structured Data Testing Tool [[google-data-testing]] to ensure that the
                metadata they create will be processed by Google properly. Researchers can copy and paste their metadata
                into the tool's form or provide a URL to a website page that has their metadata in the head of the HTML
                document.

            <p>
                Sharing detailed research data is associated with the increased citation rate of an article (Piwowar, Day, and Fridsma
                2007). Although not universal, data sharing increasingly required by journals, as a solution to the “replication
                crisis” where, for example, natural product researchers re-isolate previously described molecules (Spicer
                and Steinbeck 2017).
		    	    <aside><b>MR: Why aren’t citations from here in reference list? Also in this section need mention that not just dataset should be available.  What about code, documentation, etc…not sure what is common for this field though.  Kind of related to BP 15 and 16.</b></aside>

            <p>
                For proprietary datasets, it is recommended to provide at least
                part of it (Guha and Willighagen 2017) or/and to provide a description. There are numerous repositories,
                and researchers have to be careful about ones which are not maintained and/or don’t follow standards.
                Widely used repositories that follow good practices include Dataverse and Zenodo. For MS raw file,
                results and metadata, NPDI studies could use more specific repository like MetaboLights, which is
                completely based on open source technology, using open data formats and community based reviews
                (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/). MetaboLights adheres to MSI standards for metadata reporting and
                uses the ISA-tab format for metadata. For NMR, the COSMOS initiative (Salek et al. 2015) is similar and
                could be use by NPDI researchers to upload and share their NMR data with the nmrML format. Some users
                will benefit for the simplicity of a single file while others will want to access only a part of the
                dataset. Email is very commonly used but does not qualify as making data <i>accessible</i> because it
                depends on the data owner pushing the data to the recipient.
            </p>
	    	    <p>
	      The researcher who shares data may want to provide a means for future users of the data to ensure that the dataset has been downloaded properly and has not been modified. To do so, the researcher may generate a signature of the data they are sharing using either cryptographic or hash approaches. The signature of the data can then be shared along with the dataset with instructions on how future users can confirm data integrity. 
	    </p>
<aside><b>HS: This is another argument for submitting data to a trustworthy data repository, which generate MD5 hashes for each file version as a matter of course.</b></aside>

            <p>

            <p>
                Standard data elements should be used for both dataset metadata and the datasets themselves. For
                metadata, researchers should use broadly accepted metadata standards such as the Data Tag Suite (DATS)
                [[DATS]], Dublin Core [[DC11]], or PROV [[prov-overview]]. If researchers are contributing their data to
                a repository, researchers should confirm repository should use a widely accepted metadata standard.
                Zenodo [[zenodo]], Figshare [[figshare]], and most university/research institute data catalogs satisfy
                this recommendation.
            </p>
	    <aside><b>HS: As noted above, this is a rehash of #3 and #4.</b></aside>
            <p>
                For datasets (rather than dataset metadata), researchers should aim to maximize the reuse terms from
                existing broadly used ontologies and/or terminologies for data fields and values. One simple approach
                for data spreadsheets is to maintain a separate file with a data dictionary for the fields used in the
                dataset. The dictionary should provide each data element's name (label), definition, and persistent
                identifier. Another approach would be to provide the dataset in a format such as XML, JSON-LD, of RDF
                that can explicitly associate each data item with a standard data element. Entire sets of standard data
                elements exist for some kinds of experiments. For example, mzML is an open and generic XML (extensible
                markup language) representation of MS data [[martens-2011]]. The DIDEO ontology provides standard
                definitions for many data elements that arise from
                <emph>in vitro</emph>
                and clinical NPDI [[DIDEO-published]][[DIDEO-ontobee]]. Researcher can use ontology search tools such as
                Bioportal [[bioportal]], Ontobee [[ontobee]], or the EMBL-EBI Ontology Lookup Service
                [[ontology-lookup]] to search for candidate terms that provide clear definitions and persistent URLs.
            </p><aside><b>MR: ??  So would use ontologies to describe dataset and add keywords perhaps.  Does this need to be called out perhaps in Best practice 3? </b></aside>

            <p>
                When creating metadata it is crucial to abide by the fields of that standard. For example if you choose to utilize the DATS [[DATS]] format you must use the fields provided here <a href="https://datatagsuite.github.io/schema/dataset_schema.json"> https://datatagsuite.github.io/schema/dataset_schema.json</a> when creating metadata. This can then be validated using the python code located here: <a href="https://github.com/datatagsuite/dats-tools">https://github.com/datatagsuite/dats-tools</a>.

	      Every web page for every study and experiment deposited
	      in the <a href="repo.napdi.org">NaPDI repository</a>
	      [[birer-williams]] has a JSON-LD metadata description
	      written using Schema.org tags. For an example of this,
	      see the recommendation <a href="#rec-metadata"> Use an
	      existing machine readable metadata standard</a>. The
	      NaPDI repository uses codes from several terminologies
	      and ontologies to represent data including DIDEO [[DIDEO-ontobee]]. When users download
	      data from studies or experiments from the study web page
	      in the NaPDI repository, the user receives a data
	      dictionary file that indicates which fields used
	      standardized codes and the terminologies/ontologies that
	      they come from.

            <p>
                Representational state transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture that provides interoperability between computer systems on the internet.[[REST_explained]] The approach uses simple web-based stateless operations that generally are executed using URIs and HTTP. Access to datasets and associated metadata via a REST application programming interface (API) makes it much simpler for researchers and developers to integrate some portion of the data into web sites and applications than downloading and parsing files.
            </p>
            <h4 class="subhead" id="intended-outcome-9" resource="#intended-outcome">Intended Outcome</h4>
            <p> The primary benefit is simple programmatic access to NPDI data and metadata. APIs result in data that is
                computable and more likely to be reused in research workflows.

            <p>
                One approach to implement a REST-full API is to utilize an existing framework called Swagger and
                integrate it with your application. In the case of a spring maven project the steps would be to add a
                dependency such as <code>springfox</code> and then configure the <code>Docket</code> class as such:
            </p>

            <aside class="example">
        <pre>
          @Configuration
          @EnableSwagger2
          public class SwaggerConfig {

              @Bean
              public Docket api(){
                  return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
                      .select()
                      .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())
                      .paths(PathSelectors.regex("/api/.*"))
                      .build()
                      .apiInfo(apiInfo());
              }

              private ApiInfo apiInfo() {
                  return new ApiInfoBuilder()
                      .title("TITLE")
                      .description("DESCRIPTION")
                      .version("VERSION")
                      .termsOfServiceUrl("http://terms-of-services.url")
                      .license("LICENSE")
                      .licenseUrl("http://url-to-license.com")
                      .build();
              }
          }
        </pre>
            </aside>
            <p>
                Your Swagger 2.0 API documentation will now be available at <code>http://myapp/v2/api-docs</code>.

            <h4 class="subhead" id="how-to-test-9" resource="#how-to-test">How to Test</h4>
            <p>
                By visiting <code>http://myapp/v2/api-docs</code> you should have a UI that you can interact with.
                Simply check that every endpoint returns the expected output based on your given input.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subhead" id="example-9" resource="#example">Example</h4>
            <p>
	      Every web page for every study and experiment deposited
	      in the <a href="repo.napdi.org">NaPDI repository</a>
	      [[birer-williams]] can be retrieved via a simple REST
	      call by appending '/json' to the study or experiment
	      identifier. For example, here is a simple curl call to retreive JSON data for the study identified
	      as <a href="https://repo.napdi.org/NPDI--2FOpA/json">https://repo.napdi.org/NPDI--2FOpA</a>:
	      <pre>
		curl -L https://repo.napdi.org/NPDI--2FOpA/json
	      </pre>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      A more sophisticated REST API is provided by some other
	      data repositories where researchers could deposit NPDI
	      data. For
	      example, <a href="https://developers.zenodo.org/#introduction">the
	      Zenodo API</a> is useful for both submitting and
	      requesting data. Here is a simple example of using the
	      API to retrieve the metadata description of drug
	      interaction study data from the drug approval package
	      for Epidiolex (Cannabidiol) (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1406038">https://zenodo.org/record/1406038</a>):

            <p class="practicedesc">NPDI researcher should provide a raw data file derived from assays that
                identify and quantify the chemical constituents present in natural products, for both mass spectrometry
                (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis in an open, or at least well-documented, file format.</p>

            <h4 class="subhead" id="why-12">Why</h4>
            <p>
                Chemical analytical spectral data of a NP used for NPDI research should be accessible by the NPDI
                researcher community. Chemical metabolomic spectral data should be reusable by everyone. Researchers
                will more easily and reliably trust NPDI datasets if they have the opportunity to work on the raw data files.
                It also provides the later opportunity to launch meta analyses that advance NPDI research by providing a
                powerful new interpretation based on multiples datasets.
            </p>
            <h4 class="subhead" id="intended-outcome-12" resource="#intended-outcome">Intended Outcome</h4>
            <p>By using an open file format for raw spectral data sharing, NPDI chemical data are more accessible and
                reusable. Data sharing, repository deposition, and re-analysis of raw spectral data will be easier.
                Researchers can transfer raw data between institutions and collaborators, without the need for
                proprietary software (Rocca-Serra et al. 2015).

            <p>
                Previously, mass spectrometry open file formats, mzXML [[Pedrioli-2004]] and mzData [[Orchard-2004]], have been combined to create mzML. mzML is an open and generic XML (extensible markup language)
                representation of MS data (Martens et al. 2011). The user needs to convert MS raw data files from
                proprietary formats into an open format such as mzML. To this end, open source software for reading and
                writing mzML are useful to the user, such as Proteowizard (http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/) or
                OpenMS (http://open-ms.sourceforge.net/) , as well as package under R (mzR), Python (pymzML) and Matlab
                (MSiReader). Specific to MS metabolomics, the mzTab-M is a data standard for sharing quantitative
                results [[Hoffmann-2019]]. This is a tab-separated text format with a standardized structure
                through the design of a detailed specification document. For NMR data, nmrML is an XML based,
                vendor-neutral open exchange and data storage format which the NMR community had agree to use [[Schober-2018]]. Other initiatives are NMReDATA (nmredata.org) and the universal raw data format, Allotrope Data Format (ADF), developed by the Allotrope Foundation (allotrope.org). In NMR, the Raw Data
                Initiative is a source of information for the NPDI researcher on how to make FAIR NMR data [[McAlpine-2019]].  If open raw NMR data formats are unavailable to the user, it is still preferable to share the raw data in the native format of the instrument manufacturer. This preserves the data, enables FAIR practices, and anticipates future use with conversion tools as they become available.
            </p>
	    <p>
	      The researcher who shares data may want to provide a means for future users of the data to ensure that the dataset has been downloaded properly and has not been modified. To do so, the researcher may generate a signature of the data they are sharing using either cryptographic or hash approaches. The signature of the data can then be shared along with the dataset with instructions on how future users can confirm data integrity. 
	    </p>

            <h4 class="subhead" id="how-to-test-12" resource="#how-to-test">How to Test</h4>
            <p>
                Researchers should test if their vendor spectral file conversion to open format spectral file have been
                done correctly. They could test to upload their data to any software or program using mzXML, mzTab-M,
                nmrML or nmredata and confirm that the file is correct.
            </p>

            <p class="practicedesc">NPDI researcher should share and publish NMR and spectroscopic results following standards
                recognized by the field. For example, spectral images must to have a good resolution, NMR assigned peaks
                tables or text have to be complete and to follow standards, filtered peak list with intensity in
                metabolomics have to be shared and identification of compounds have to follow standard procedure.</p>

            <h4 class="subhead" id="why-13">Why</h4>
            <p>
                This practice will make NPDI NMR and spectroscopic results FAIR for the community to analyze and interpret. Data
                will already have been transformed making them accessible for a quick and easy interpretation of the
                results.

            <p>
                Reporting of NMR spectra is most frequently done using tables or descriptive text including HSQC, HMBC,
                and NOE correlations, as well as listings of chemical shifts, coupling constants, multiplicities and
                assignments [[McAlpine-2019]]. Journals provide guidelines, such as the ACS family of journals (“NMR Guidelines for
                ACS Journals,” n.d.).
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      It is recommended to upload the spectral file as a
                vector graphics image, ideally in an open and
                standardized format such as SVG or, if not possible,
                as PDF. At a minimum, upload an image with a high
                resolution. Whenever possible,
                such graphical representations should contain signal
                assignments that work in tandem with the descriptive
                text and tables. To share high quality data in MS,
                mass spectra are also shared as an image to visualize
                fragmentation pattern in the case of tandem
                MS. Regarding metabolite identification in MS, the
                Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) had defined
                four different levels of metabolites identification,
                which are identified metabolites (level 1), putatively
                annotated compounds (level 2), putatively
                characterized compound classes (level 3) and unknown
                compound (level 4) [[Salek-2013]].  It is recommended
                to report for the metabolite identification the level
                of identification, the common name and the structural
                code like the InChI string. Also, external database
                identifiers, chemical structure image and chemical
                formula are frequently reported.

                Experiment metadata covers the whole range necessary to understand how the experiment was conducted: the
                species under investigation, which organism part the metabolite was isolated from, which instruments
                were used, and which parameters were used. Researcher could use the properly documented metadata format
                IsaTab [[Salek-2013]] (ISA for Investigation, Study and Assay), as well as the raw data format
                Allotrope Raw Data format (https://www.allotrope.org) in NPDI studies. Every metadata is backed by a
                term in a commonly used ontology. Researchers should follow the minimal information standard, as created
                by the Metabolomics society in 2007, with the metabolomics standards initiative (MSI Board Members et
                al. 2007). Similar initiatives are undergoing for NMR studies, where the ISA format is also recommended
                [[McAlpine-2019]].

	  are involved, what is the test system, the object and it’s
